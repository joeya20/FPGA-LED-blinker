# FPGA-LED-blinker
This project was completed as an effort to learn verilog and as continuation of ENEL 453 to become more familiar with RTL design.

The project uses 3 switches as inputs and a 10 LED array as output. Depending on the state of the switches, the LEDs will be on/off and blink at different frequencies, at a duty cycle of 50%.

Switch 1 and 2:
  - Toggle between 1Hz, 5Hz, 10Hz, and 25Hz

 Switch 3:
  - Enable (turn LEDs on/off)
